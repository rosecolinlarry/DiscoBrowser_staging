# DiscoBrowser

Heavily inspired by [FAYDE Playback Experiment: On-Air](https://fayde.co.uk/).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

This repo is to allow for free hosting with GitHub pages and is _not intended_ for code contributions from others. The code is quite messy, spaghetti, and definitely not clean code! I plan to continue cleaning and refining it as I go (for my own sanity) but with that being said, clone at your own risk!

## Overview

Disco Browser is a lightweight, browser-based tool for exploring and searching Disco Elysium dialogue data stored in an SQLite database. Hosted by GitHub pages, visit the site here: https://rosecolinlarry.github.io/DiscoBrowser/.

## Purpose

I created this to be my own personal version of [Fayde](https://fayde.co.uk/) as the website is often down and sometimes I just get the hankering to read some good Moralist lore. While my intention is to offer the functionality of FAYDE, and much of the features are based off of it, there are missing features and also unique components. I believe it also includes more of the orbs than the Fayde contemplate orbs page.

One bonus is you can quickly search the entire database of dialogue from the game. Just hit the search button without any search text entered. Results should appear within a second. With infinite scroll, it will load more entries as you scroll.

Note: There are some dialogue that is in the game files but not presented in game and/or are test conversations included by the developers. I am working on trying to hide anything that is not in the game from the conversation tree. You can see them by toggling the show hidden conversation setting.

## Main Features

- **Conversation explorer**
  - Browse conversations in a collapsible, hierarchical tree built from conversation titles.
  - Type badges highlight conversation kinds (flows, orbs, tasks, etc.).
  - Resize this column by hovering over the right side and dragging (similar to file explorer)
- **Simple Search**
  - Search dialogue text and variable text with support for:
  - Quoted phrase searches
  - Whole-word toggle
  - Actor-scoped search
  - Pagination / “load more” (search limits)
- **Filters and scopes**
  - Filter search results by actor, conversation types (flow/orb/task), and/or specific conversations
  - Select / deselect all actors/types for quick narrowing/widening.
- **Detail view for entries**
  - Render entry overview and full details including:
  - Alternates (alternate lines and conditions)
  - Checks (skills, difficulty)
  - Parents / children links (dlinks)
  - Entry and conversation metadata tables
- **History & navigation**
  - Navigation history (chat log) with back / root navigation to re-open conversations and entries.
  - Can also use the browser's navigation buttons
  - Also able to be resized by dragging the left side of the column
- **Mobile  experience**
  - Dedicated mobile search screen, mobile filter screens, and a bottom-sheet type picker.
  - Does not support resizing the columns
- **Settings**
  - UI preferences: disable animations, reset layout, show hidden conversations, toggle resizing, etc.
- **Static Site - No Server**
  - Runs entirely in the browser using the included sql-wasm engine to read a local SQLite DB (no server dependency required)
  - Single page website
- **Performance & caching**
  - Entry-level caching, batched queries, and lazy/iterative tree rendering to keep UI responsive.

## Installation & Usage

- Place the conversation database file at discobase.sqlite3 (or update path in initDatabase).
- Serve the folder over a local static server (recommended) or open index.html in a browser that permits loading WASM from file:
  - Example: `python -m http.server 8000` (serve from project root) or npx http-server
- Open http://localhost:8000 (or the file URL) and use the search box, filters, or the conversation tree to explore entries.

## Behavior notes & implementation details

1. Search supports quoted phrases and multi-word queries; use the Whole Words option for stricter matches.
2. Results show a snippet card (title + meta + highlighted snippet); clicking opens the entry overview and details.
3. Conversation tree is built from conversation titles split on / and collapsed for readability.
